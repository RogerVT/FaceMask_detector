# FaceMask_detector
These repository contains information, notebooks and code used to build a numpy, image-based, medical face mask detector. The hierarchical data files found here are taken from the [Face Mask ~12K Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset). Feel free to use the files or the code used to transform the 11.8k images to .h5.
